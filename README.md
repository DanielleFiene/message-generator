# **Random Message Generator API**

A simple yet powerful Node.js application that generates and serves random inspirational, humorous, or encouraging messages through a RESTful API. This project showcases my skills in building a backend server with Express, creating an API, and connecting it to a user-friendly frontend interface.

## **Features**
- A RESTful API that generates random messages by combining subjects, actions, and advice.
- Frontend functionality using vanilla JavaScript to fetch data from the API and display it dynamically.
- Static file serving with Express for smooth integration of frontend and backend.
- Modular and maintainable code structure.

## **Demo**
Here's how the project works:
1. A user clicks the "Generate" button.
2. The app fetches a random message from the `/api/message` endpoint.
3. The message is displayed dynamically on the web page.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the backend server.
- **Express**: Lightweight framework for creating the RESTful API and serving static files.
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: For fetching API data and manipulating the DOM in the frontend.

---

## **How It Works**

### **Backend**
- The server is built using **Node.js** and **Express**.
- **API Endpoint**:  
  - `GET /api/message`  
    This endpoint responds with a random message in JSON format.  
    Example response:  
    ```json
    {
        "message": "Your life is full of daily surprises, so stay positive."
    }
    ```

### **Frontend**
- The frontend consists of a simple HTML and CSS (flexbox, animations, gradients) file and JavaScript logic.
- When the user clicks the "Generate" button:
  - The app makes a `fetch` request to `/api/message`.
  - The response is parsed and displayed on the page.
